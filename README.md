**Author:** Eric Rosenberg  
**Module:** 4FSC0PD001 – Game Programming Basics  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress  
**Project Type:** University Project (SAE Institute Stuttgart)

## 🎮 Project Description

The *Monster Battle Simulator* is an official **university project** developed as part of the *Game Programming Basics* module.  
Its goal is to create a **turn-based battle system** where various monsters with unique attributes such as **health, attack, defense, and special abilities** compete against each other.  

The project is currently **under active development**, with a focus on clean object-oriented design, solid architecture, and scalability for future modules.

## 🧩 Rough Development Plan

- **Phase 1:** Core class structure (Monster, Arena, BattleManager)  
- **Phase 2:** Implementation of battle logic (attack, damage, round flow)  
- **Phase 3:** Introduction of special abilities, status effects, and random elements  
- **Phase 4:** Console UI and visual battle representation  
- **Phase 5:** Balancing, code refactoring, and final documentation  

## 🧱 Current Progress

- Core class structure in progress  
- Initial concepts for BattleManager and monster attributes defined  
- Project setup completed in Visual Studio 2022  
- README created and development framework documented  

## 🧾 Notes

This project is part of the ongoing **Bachelor’s degree program at the SAE Institute Stuttgart**.  
It is being developed, tested, and documented step by step.  
The goal is to build a **functional prototype** that can be further expanded in future modules.
